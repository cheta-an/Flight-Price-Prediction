## Introduction
This project predicts flight prices based on various features such as the airline, source, destination, and the number of stops. It uses machine learning models such as Linear Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest to perform the predictions.

## Project Structure
1. code.ipynb: The main Jupyter Notebook containing all the code to load the dataset, preprocess it, build models, and evaluate their performance.

2. FlightPrice.xlsx: The dataset contains flight-related information, including features like Airline, Date_of_Journey, Source, Destination, Route	Dep_Time, Arrival_Time, Duration, Total_Stops, Additional_Info, and Price.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/cheta-an/Flight-Price-Prediction.git
   ```
2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
## Usage
